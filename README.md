Chess Test App
Welcome to the Chess Test App! This simple app is designed to test your ability to correctly place chess pieces on the board. The goal is to drag and place each piece in its appropriate square and see if you've placed them correctly.

How to Use:
Right-click on any square: This will open a context menu showing the available chess pieces you can place on that square.
Click on a piece: Choose a piece from the context menu and place it on the selected square.
Mistakes? No worries!: If you accidentally place the wrong piece, simply right-click again and choose the correct one. You can do this as many times as you need.
Ready to Submit?: Once you’re confident that all pieces are placed correctly, hit the SUBMIT button to view your results.

Rules:
There’s no time limit for this test, so take your time.
You can try as many times as you need to place the pieces correctly.
When you're sure everything is in its place, click SUBMIT to see your result.
